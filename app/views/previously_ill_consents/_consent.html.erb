<p>
    <strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    You are being asked to take part in a research study. This document has important information about the reason for the study, what you will do if you
    choose to be in this research study, and the way we would like to use information about you and your health. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<h2>
    What is the reason for doing this study?<em></em>
</h2>
<p>
    You are being asked to participate in an Influenza study because you had a test that was positive for Influenza A virus after January 2003. Influenza A
    virus infection causes significant disease burden in the United States and around the world. Your medical information and blood sample will help us
    determine how your genes and immune system interact with the Influenza A virus to fight disease. Through this research study, we hope to find new ways to
    treat and prevent this often serious, respiratory virus infection.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>What will you do if you choose to be in this study? </u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Should you agree to participate, you will be asked to:
</p>
<p>
    1. visit the Northwestern Medicine Infectious Disease Center (located at the Arkes Pavilion 9th Floor, Suite 940, 251 E Huron Street, Chicago, IL 60611) to
    allow us to draw blood. We will obtain approximately 20 ml (about 4 teaspoons) of blood from a vein in your arm. From this sample, we will be able to get
    DNA, which stores your genetic information; <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    and
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
    <li>
        allow us to review your medical records to obtain health information related to your influenza-like illness, such as complications you may have had
        from the infection as well as treatment you received
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    and
</p>
<p>
    3. allow us to analyze the influenza A virus you were infected with using stored samples.
</p>
<p>
    Your blood sample will be sent to The Fred and A. Norman Drucker Laboratory for Virology Research located in Chicago, IL, that is overseen by Northwestern
    University. The only information we include with the sample is a unique identification number that will be generated when you agree to participate.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Genetic research</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Should you agree, some of your genetic and health information might be placed into other scientific databases on the Internet that are maintained by the
    Federal government. Information that could directly identify you will never be placed into a scientific database. Researchers will study different sets of
    samples — some from people who have had a severe influenza-like illness and some from people who have not, in order to look for areas in your genome where
    the patterns of variation differ between these two groups. This information will give researchers a clue about those areas in your genome that might
    contain genes that affect the disease. They will use scientific databases to look at the genetic changes in those regions, to help figure out which genes
    might affect the disease. Researchers can then study how the genes work and eventually find better ways to prevent or treat infection with Influenza A
    virus.
</p>
<p>
    You should not expect to get individual genetic results from research with your sample. Researchers must study information and samples over many years
    before they can know if the results have meaning. We will not give the results to your doctor. We will not put them in your medical record.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u></u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>What are some of the possible risks and discomforts?</u> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Your participation in this study may involve some risks.
</p>
<p>
    Risks of taking blood include fainting, a bruise at the point where the blood is taken, redness and swelling of the vein and infection.
</p>
<p>
    Your genetic information is unique to you; therefore, there is a small chance that someone could trace it back to you. We think the chance these things
    will happen is very small, but we cannot make guarantees. Your privacy and the confidentiality of your data are very important to us and we will make every
    effort to protect them. Federal privacy rules give safeguards for privacy, security, and authorized access.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>What are the Possible Benefits for Me or Others?</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    You are not likely to have any direct benefit from being in this research study.
</p>
<p>
    The main reason you may want to take part is to help researchers find new ways to prevent and treat the illness and its’ complications.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Will I receive payment for participation in this study? </u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    You will not be paid for your participation in this study.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Are there any financial costs to being in this study</u>?<em></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Participation in this study will involve no cost to you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Blood samples stored for future research </u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Allowing for the storage and future testing of your blood samples will involve no cost to you. Your sample will be used only for research and will not be
    sold. The research done with your blood sample may lead to the development of new products in the future. No compensation will be given to you now or in
    the future for the use of these samples.<strong></strong>
</p>

<p>
    We are committed to respect your privacy and to keep your personal information confidential. When choosing to take part in this study, you are giving us
    the permission to use your personal health information that includes health information in your medical records and information that can identify you. For
    example, personal health information may include your name, address or phone number. Your health information we may collect and use for this research
    includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Medical history
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    · Lab tests, or certain health information indicating or relating to Influenza infection <u></u>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The following groups of people may give the researchers information about you: </strong>
</p>
<p>
    · All current and previous health care providers, including but not limited to Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation (NMFF), Northwestern Memorial
    Physicians Group (NMPG), Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH)
</p>
<p>
    Once we have the health information listed above, we may share some of this information with the following people. Please note that any research
    information shared with people outside of Northwestern University and its clinical partners (or affiliates) will not contain your name, address, telephone
    or social security number or any other direct personal identifier unless disclosure of the direct identifier is required by law [except that such
    information may be viewed by the Study sponsor and its partners or contractors at the Principal Investigators office]<strong> .</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Those persons who get your health information may not be required by Federal privacy laws (such as the Privacy Rule) to protect it. Some of those persons
    may be able to share your information with others without your separate permission.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    There is a Federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). This law makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health
    plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. However, it does not protect you against discrimination by
    companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Certificate of Confidentiality</u></strong>
    <strong><u> </u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    We have a Certificate of Confidentiality from the federal government. A Certificate of Confidentiality helps protect the privacy of human research
    participants enrolled in studies that collect sensitive information. Certificates protect against legal demands, such as court orders and subpoenas, for
information that could identify you in this study. For additional information about Certificates of Confidentiality see    <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/coc/faqs.htm">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/coc/faqs.htm</a>.<strong></strong>
