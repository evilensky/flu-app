  <h3>Steven Wolinsky, MD</h3>
  Principal Investigator<br />
  <p style="clear:both;">Dr. Steven Wolinsky is a Professor of Medicine at Northwestern University. His research focuses on the evolutionary mechanisms underlying hostâ€”pathogen interactions, and their role in the emergence, spread, and containment of infectious diseases such as Influenza and HIV. His work seeks to understand how viral genetic variation, driven by host genetics and immunity, affects viral infection dynamics and epidemic behavior. This connection is central to the evolution of virulence and drug resistance, and to vaccine design.
